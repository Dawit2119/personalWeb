                    <h2>Educational Backgrounds</h2>
                    <p>I have started my childhood education when I had gotten at 7 at local kindergarten and successfully finished it . In this step I had gotten all the required things to start the primary education. In 2006 I had started the primary education at Yekatit 25 Primary school. In this school I had spent eight years and I had brought so many psychological, behavioral, mental changes. In this school I was one of the outstanding students in which most of the time I had got the first result from the whole school and I had never beaten by anyone when there is questions and answer program at school or from cluster of five schools. I have thought basic concepts of mathematics , physics , Biology and others and completed the primary education after taking the regional primary education completion exam with better performance in in 2014.</p><br>
                    <p>I had attended secondary education for 4 years at Dinkula general secondary and preparatory school from 2014-2018. I have experienced much more knowledge and basic things such as some computing technologies in my high school studies. My lower class habit of hard working also continued in this stage. I had made the result that is first to the class and to the school in grade 9. in 2016 I had took the Ethiopian General Secondary Education completion exam and I had made straight A or (9A).
                    </p><br>
                    <p> I was joined the Preparatory school in September 2016. The preparatory education was the most exciting one I have encountered. In this time I have collaborated to my classmates on most Chemistry and Physics lab projects, and Studying for the exams. In this June ,I took the Ethiopian university entrance exam and made some how good result.</p><br>
                    <p>In September 2018, I have joined the Addis Ababa University. This time was the most challenging time in my life because I am the countryside student so it requires some time to follow up the lifestyles. In fist semester of the year (2018-19 I have spent most of the time at reading at the end I made kind of good result and joined the information technology and scientific computing department. The second semester was also challenging because there were so many assignments and projects that made me so busy. Nevertheless I have completed the the academic year . Now I am second year software engineering student. I have some skills on some programming languages if you want see the Hire me tab.</p>
