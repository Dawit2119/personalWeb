Located in the Semien (North) Gondar Zone of the Amhara Region, its territory covers the Semien Mountains and includes Ras Dashan, the highest point in Ethiopia. It is home to a number of endangered species, including the Ethiopian wolf and the walia ibex, a wild goat found nowhere else in the world. The gelada baboon and the caracal, a cat, also occur within the Simien Mountains. More than 50 species of birds inhabit the park, including the impressive bearded vulture, or lammergeier, with its 3 m (10 ft)) wingspan.

It is best known for its archaeological site, a UNESCO World Heritage Site remarkable for its large stone pillars, many of which bear some form of decoration. The menhir or stelae, "32 of which are engraved with enigmatic symbols, notably swords," mark a large, prehistoric burial complex.[2] A German ethnographic expedition had visited the site in April 1935, and had found at one hour's journey to the south of the caravan camp the stone monoliths with sword symbol, which had been seen earlier by Neuville and Père Azaïs.

                                Nelson Mandela was one of Africa’s finest citizens and statesmen. He was a South African president (1994-1999) who fought against the apartheid political system in the country. As South Africa’s first black president, his government tackled key racial systems that segregated and tore apart the country’s diverse races. Mandela was a revolutionary who got imprisoned on several occasions for his activism

                                Haile Selassie, also known as Ras Tafari Makonnen, was an Ethiopian ruler and emperor from 1916 to 1974. Undoubtedly, Selassie was one of the biggest sons of Africa whose name can never be erased from history. Even at a young age, Selassie showed promising intellectual capacity. His intelligence quickly earned him political appointments from the Ethiopian emperor.

                                Kwame Nkrumah is a highly revered Ghanaian politician who led the country in 1957 (formerly Gold Coast) to gain independence from the country’s colonial masters (Britain). One can conclude that he was the founder of Ghana, without being too wrong. Nkrumah was the first president and Prime Minister of Ghana. He was a Pan-Africanist who co-founded the Africa Union (A.U) (formerly the Organization of African Union).

                                Africa’s first female head of state’s name cannot be omitted from this list. We still have some space to honor her and also to balance the political equation. Johnson-Sirleaf, commonly known as “Africa’s Iron Lady”, is a former Liberian president who was in office from 2006 to 2018. She is a Harvard graduate with an economics degree who fought hard from prisons and exile and became an inspiration to many young female politicians.
